# /arc:test $ARGUMENTS

Write, run, and audit tests — driven by Acceptance Criteria, not by code.

## Usage

```
/arc:test write JRA-123           Write tests from AC scenarios
/arc:test validate JRA-123        Run tests and report results
/arc:test review JRA-123          Review test quality against methodology
/arc:test mutate JRA-123          Audit test quality with mutation testing
```

| Argument | Format | Default | Effect |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `write` \| `validate` \| `review` \| `mutate` | Subcommand (first token) | — | Determines workflow (required) |
| `ticket-id` | Positional | — | Ticket identifier — used to locate AC and test files |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Flag | `false` | Skip confirmation gates |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

1. First non-flag token → `subcommand` (`write`, `validate`, `review`, or `mutate`). If missing or not one of these → error: "Subcommand required. Usage: `/arc:test write|validate|review|mutate {ticket-id}`" and stop.
2. Next non-flag token → `ticket-id`. If missing → error: "Ticket ID required. Usage: `/arc:test {subcommand} {ticket-id}`" and stop.
3. `-y` or `--yes` anywhere → `skip_confirmations = true`

### Step 2: Route to Subcommand

Read the corresponding sub-instruction file and follow all steps:

| Subcommand | File | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `write` | [write.md](write.md) | Generate tests from AC — does not run them |
| `validate` | [validate.md](validate.md) | Run tests — pure execution, does not write code |
| `review` | [review.md](review.md) | Review test quality against methodology — read-only audit |
| `mutate` | [mutate.md](mutate.md) | AI-driven mutation testing — audits test quality |

## Core Principle

**Tests must be written from requirements, not from code.**

```
❌ Bad:  Code → "what does this do?" → test
✅ Good: AC scenario → "what should happen?" → test
```

A test written from code is a tautology — if the code has a bug, the test locks it in as correct behavior. A test written from AC catches the bug because it describes what SHOULD happen, not what DOES happen.

**Criterion:** if you can do a major refactoring (rename components, restructure folders, change state management) and all tests stay green — the tests are good. If tests break on refactoring that doesn't change behavior — they test implementation details, not requirements.

## Shared Context

**Project context:** `.arcana/project-context.md` — read first. Contains AC file locations, test runner, API type, framework, and conventions.

**Report output location:** `.arcana/{feature}/{ticket-id}/` (temp, gitignored)

**Reference material:** [references/testing-strategy.md](references/testing-strategy.md) — decision matrix, mocking rules, contract safety, test writing algorithm. Search patterns for large file:
- `## Decision Matrix` — which test level for which AC type
- `## Mocking Rules` — what to mock, what not to mock
- `## Element Selection Strategy` — selector priority, test-id rules
- `## Test Writing Algorithm` — 5-step process
- `## Bug Coverage` — how to cover bugs with tests
- `## Implementation Details` — what not to test

## Troubleshooting

### Error: No AC files found
Cause: AC files don't exist yet for this ticket.
Solution: Run `/arc:ac enrich` or `/arc:prd create` first. Without AC, tests would be written from code — which this skill explicitly avoids.

### Tests break on refactoring
Cause: Tests are coupled to implementation details (internal state, method names, CSS classes).
Solution: Rewrite tests to interact only through user-facing interfaces. See "Implementation Details" section in [references/testing-strategy.md](references/testing-strategy.md).
