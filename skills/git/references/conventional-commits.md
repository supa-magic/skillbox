# Conventional Commits 1.0.0

> Source: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

## Summary

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

## Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Types

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature (correlates with MINOR in SemVer) |
| `fix` | Bug fix (correlates with PATCH in SemVer) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace (no code logic change) |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependencies update |
| `build` | Build system, external dependencies |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration |
| `revert` | Revert previous commit |

## Specification

1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, `feat`, `fix`, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL `!`, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
2. The type `feat` MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
3. The type `fix` MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
4. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., `fix(parser):`.
5. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., `fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string`.
6. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
7. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
8. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a `:<space>` or `<space>#` separator, followed by a string value.
9. A footer's token MUST use `-` in place of whitespace characters, e.g., `Acked-by` (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for `BREAKING CHANGE`, which MAY also be used as a token.
10. A footer's value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
11. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.
12. If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text `BREAKING CHANGE`, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., `BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files`.
13. If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a `!` immediately before the `:`. If `!` is used, `BREAKING CHANGE:` MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.
14. Types other than `feat` and `fix` MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., `docs: update ref docs`.
15. The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of `BREAKING CHANGE` which MUST be uppercase.
16. `BREAKING-CHANGE` MUST be synonymous with `BREAKING CHANGE`, when used as a token in a footer.

## Examples

### Commit with description and breaking change footer

```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

### Commit with `!` to draw attention to breaking change

```
feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

### Commit with scope and `!` to draw attention to breaking change

```
feat(api)!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

### Commit with no body

```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

### Commit with scope

```
feat(lang): add Polish language
```

### Commit with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers

```
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.
